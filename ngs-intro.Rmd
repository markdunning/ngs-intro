# Why do sequencing?

## Microarrays vs sequencing

- Probe design issues with microarrays
    + *'Dorian Gray effect'* http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/111
    + ' ...mappings are frozen, as a Dorian Gray-like syndrome: the apparent eternal youth of the mapping does not reflect that somewhere the 'picture of it' decays'
- Sequencing data are 'future proof'
    + if a new genome version comes along, just re-align the data!
    + can grab published-data from public repositories and re-align to **your** own choice of genome / transcripts and aligner
- Limited number of novel findings from microarays
    + can't find what you're not looking for!
- Genome coverage
    + some areas of genome are problematic to design probes for
- Maturity of analysis techniques
    + on the other hand, analysis methods and workflows for microarrays are well-established
    + until recently...

# What are NGS data?


## Different terminologies for same thing

- *N*ext *G*eneration *S*equencing
- *H*igh-*T*hroughput *S*equencing
- 2nd Generation Sequencing
- Massively Parallel Sequencing
- Also different library preparation
    + RNA-seq *
    + ChIP-seq *
    + Exome-seq
    + DNA-seq
    + Methyl-seq
    + .....





## Illumina sequencing *

- Employs a *'sequencing-by-synthesis'* approach

## Paired-end

![seq4](images/paired-end.png)


## Multiplexing
![seq5](images/pooling.png)


## Image processing 

- Sequencing produces high-resolution TIFF images; not unlike microarray data
- 100 tiles per lane, 8 lanes per flow cell, 100 cycles
- 4 images (A,G,C,T) per tile per cycle = 320,000 images
- Each *TIFF* image ~ 7Mb = 2,240,000 Mb of data (**2.24TB**)

![cluster](images/c6vllanxx_c001_l1_t001_bot_s1_a.jpg)

## Image processing

- Firecrest

![firecrest](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Regulus_ignicapilla_Arundel.jpg/300px-Regulus_ignicapilla_Arundel.jpg)


- *"Uses the raw TIF files to locate clusters on the image, and outputs the cluster intensity, X,Y positions, and an estimate of the noise for each cluster. The output from image analysis provides the input for base calling."*

    + http://openwetware.org/wiki/BioMicroCenter:IlluminaDataPipeline
- **You will never have to do this**
    + In fact, the TIFF images are deleted by the instrument
    
## Base-calling

- Bustard

![bustard](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Ardeotis_kori_Etosha.JPG/300px-Ardeotis_kori_Etosha.JPG)

- *"Uses cluster intensities and noise estimate to output the sequence of bases read from each cluster, along with a confidence level for each base."*
    + http://openwetware.org/wiki/BioMicroCenter:IlluminaDataPipeline
- **You will never have to do this**

## Alignment

- Locating where each generated sequence came from in the genome
- Outside the scope of this course
- *Usually* perfomed automatically by a sequencing service
- For most of what follows in the course, we will assume alignment has been performed and we are dealing with aligned data
    + Popular aligners
    + bwa http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/
    + bowtie http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml
    + novoalign http://www.novocraft.com/products/novoalign/
    + stampy http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/project-stampy
    + many, many more.....


## Post-processing of aligned files

- Marking of PCR duplicates
    + PCR amplification errors can cause some sequences to be over-represented
    + Chances of any two sequences aligning to the same position are *unlikely*
    + Caveat: obviously this depends on amount of the genome you are capturing
    + Such reads are *marked* but not usually removed from the data
    + Most downstream methods will ignore such reads
    + Typically, [***picard***](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) is used 
- Sorting
    + Reads can be sorted according to genomic position
        + [***samtools***](http://www.htslib.org/)
- Indexing
    + Allow efficient access
        + [***samtools***](http://www.htslib.org/)


# Data formats

## Raw reads - fastq

- The most basic file type you will see is *fastq*
    + Data in public-repositories (e.g. Short Read Archive, GEO) tend to be in this format
- This represents all sequences created after imaging process
- Each sequence is described over 4 lines
- No standard file extension. *.fq*, *.fastq*, *.sequence.txt*
- Essentially they are text files
    + Can be manipulated with standard unix tools; e.g. *cat*, *head*, *grep*, *more*, *less*
- They can be compressed and appear as *.fq.gz*
- Same format regardless of sequencing protocol (i.e. RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNA-seq etc)

```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```
~ 250 Million reads (sequences) per Hi-Seq lane

## Fastq sequence names

```
@HWUSI-EAS100R:6:73:941:1973#0/1
```

- The name of the sequencer (HWUSI-EAS100R)
- The flow cell lane (6)
- Tile number with the lane (73)
- x co-ordinate within the tile (941)
- y co-ordinate within the tile (1973)
- \#0 index number for a multiplexed sample 
-  /1; the member of a pair, /1 or /2 (paired-end or mate-pair reads only)

## Fastq quality scores

```
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

- Quality scores $$ Q = -10log_{10}p$$
    + Q = 30, p=0.001
    + Q = 20, p=0.01
    + Q = 10, p=0.1
- These numeric quanties are *encoded* as **ASCII** code
    + Sometimes an offset is used before encoding

- Based on these plots we may want to *trim* our data
    + A popular choice is ***trimmomatic*** http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic
    + or ***Trim Galore!*** from the makers of FastQC

## Aligned reads - sam

- **S**equence **A**lignment **M**atrix (sam) http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf

    + Read name
    + Chromosome
    + Position
    + Mapping quality
    + etc...

## Sam file flags

- Represent useful QC information
    + Read is unmapped
    + Read is paired / unpaired
    + Read failed QC
    + Read is a PCR duplicate 
- https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html

![sam-flags](images/sam-flags.png)

## Aligned reads - bam

- *Exactly* the same information as a sam file
- ..except that it is *binary* version of sam
- compressed around x4
- Attempting to read will print garbage to the screen
- bam files can be indexed
    + Produces an index file with the same name as the bam file, but with **.bai** extension

```
samtools view mysequences.bam | head
```

- N.B The sequences can be extracted by various tools to give *fastq*

## samtools flagstat

- Useful *command-line* tool as part of **samtools**

```
$ samtools flagstat NA19914.chr22.bam
2109857 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)
0 + 0 secondary
0 + 0 supplimentary
40096 + 0 duplicates
2064356 + 0 mapped (97.84%:-nan%)
2011540 + 0 paired in sequencing
1005911 + 0 read1
1005629 + 0 read2
1903650 + 0 properly paired (94.64%:-nan%)
1920538 + 0 with itself and mate mapped
45501 + 0 singletons (2.26%:-nan%)
5134 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr
4794 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5)

```



## Aligned files in IGV

- Once our bam files have been *indexed* we can view them in IGV
- This is **highly recommended**

# Why use R for High-Throughput Analysis?

## Support for R

- Online forums
- Local user groups
- Documentation via `?` or `help.start()`
- `browseVignettes()` to see package user guides ('*vignettes*')
- ***Get into the habit of using these***
    + or ***google***

## RStudio

![RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/blue-125.png)

- Rstudio is a free environment for R
- Convenient menus to access scripts, display plots
- Still need to use *command-line* to get things done
- Developed by some of the leading R programmers

## Typical tasks in an R analysis

- Read some data from a `.csv` or `.txt` file
    + R creates some representation of the data
- Explore the data
    + Subset, manipulate to pull out interesting observations
    + Plotting
    + Statistical testing
- Output the results

## The Bioconductor project

![BioC](images/logo_bioconductor.png)

-  Packages analyse all kinds of Genomic data (>800)
- Compulsory documentation (*vignettes*) for each package
- 6-month release cycle
- Course Materials
- Example data and workflows
- Common, re-usable framework and functionality
- Available [Support](https://support.bioconductor.org/)

## Example packages

![citations](images/citations.png)

## Downloading a package

Each package has its own landing page. e.g. http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/beadarray.html. Here you'll find;

- Installation script (will install all dependancies)
- Vignettes and manuals
- Details of package maintainer
- After downloading, you can load using the `library` function. e.g. `library(beadarray)`

## Reading data using Bioconductor

Recall that data can be read into R using `read.csv`, `read.delim`, `read.table` etc. Several packages provided special modifications of these to read raw data from different manufacturers

- `limma` for various two-colour platforms
- `affy` for Affymetrix data
- `beadarray`, `lumi`, `limma` for Illumina BeadArray data
- A common class is used to represent the data

## Reading data using Bioconductor

A dataset may be split into different components

- Matrix of expression values
- Sample information
- Annotation for the probes

In Bioconductor we will often put these data the same object for easy referencing. The `Biobase` package has all the code to do this.

## Example data

```{r results='hide',echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(Biobase))
```
- Biobase is the package that provide the infrastructure to represent microarray data
- Evaluating the name of the object does not print the whole object to screen
```{r}
library(Biobase)
data(sample.ExpressionSet)
sample.ExpressionSet
```

## Extracting data

- Convenient `accessor` functions are provided
- Each row is a ***gene***
- Each column is a ***sample***
```{r}
evals <- exprs(sample.ExpressionSet)
dim(evals)
evals[1:4,1:3]
```

## Extracting data

- Note the *rows* in the sample information are in the same order as the *columns* in the expression matrix
   + information about the sample in ***column*** 1 of the expression matrix is in ***row*** 1 of the pheno data
   + etc

```{r}
sampleMat <- pData(sample.ExpressionSet)
dim(sampleMat)
head(sampleMat)
```



## Subsetting rules
`ExpressionSet` objects are designed to behave like data frames. e.g. to subset the first 10 genes


```{r}
sample.ExpressionSet[1:10,]
```

## Subsetting rules

What does this do?

```{r}
sample.ExpressionSet[,1:10]
```


## Starting to visualise the data

Recall that several plots can be created from a *vector* of numerical values

```{r}
hist(evals[,1])
```

## Starting to visualise the data

Or from a data frame

```{r}
boxplot(evals[,1:5])
```

## Starting to visualise the data

One sample against another 
```{r}
plot(evals[,1],evals[,2])
```

## Starting to visualise the data

One gene against another
```{r}
plot(evals[1,],evals[2,])
```


## The MA plot

We often work with **M** and **A** values as defined


```{r warning=FALSE}
M <- log2(evals[,1]) - log2(evals[,2])
A <- 0.5*(log2(evals[,1]) + log2(evals[,2]))
plot(A,M)
```

## The MA plot

- log transformation is used to put values on scale 0 to 16
- Line *M=0* indicates equivalent expression in two arrays
    + where we would expect most genes to be
- Outliers on y axis are *candidates* to be *differentially expressed*

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
M <- log2(evals[,1]) - log2(evals[,2])
A <- 0.5*(log2(evals[,1]) + log2(evals[,2]))
plot(A,M)
abline(h=0,lty=2,col="red")
points(A[which(abs(M) > 3.5)], M[which(abs(M) > 3.5)],col="red",pch=20)
```


## Statistical Testing

- `R` started as a language *for* statisticians, *made by* statisticians
- naturally, it has a whole range of statistical tests available as functions
    + `t.test`
    + `wilcox.test`
    + `var.test`
    + `anova`
    + etc.....
```{r echo=FALSE}
mygene <- evals[314,]
myfactor <- pData(sample.ExpressionSet)$sex
```

## Statistical Testing


```{r}
mygene
myfactor

```

## Statistical Testing

The ***tilde*** (`~`) is R's way of creating a ***formula***
```{r}
boxplot(mygene~myfactor)
```


## Statistical Testing
```{r}
t.test(mygene~myfactor)
```

- we need to be wary of multiple-testing issues

## Biological Interpretation of Results

- Bioconductor provide a number of annotation packages
    + e.g. `hgu95av2.db` which can be installed in the same manner as other Bioconductor packages
    + can map between manufacturer ID more-familiar IDs
    + can map to pathways ontologies
        + using the latest database versions etc
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(hgu95av2.db)
mget("31553_at",hgu95av2SYMBOL)
mget("31553_at",hgu95av2ENTREZID)
mget("31553_at",hgu95av2GO)
```

## Introducing the practical

- Refresh your memory of R skills
    + reading data
    + subsetting data
    + plotting
- Introduce some Bioconductor classes
